        <p>Machu Picchu, one of the New Seven Wonders of the World and Peru's most famous tourist destination, lives up to its reputation as a mysterious and awe-inspiring 15th-century archaeological monument. Machu Picchu was built with extraordinary precision and attention to detail and stands at a height of 2430m (7972ft) above sea level. It comprises temples, private chambers, and ceremonial platforms that continue to emanate mystical energy. 
        <br><br>
        Machu Picchu, which means "old peak" in the Indigenous Quechua language of the Andes, is a two-hour train ride from the Sacred Valley town of Ollantaytambo, or the truly intrepid can walk in the footsteps of the Incas along the classic Inca Trail, a four- to five-day trek that covers 42 kilometres (26 miles).</p>

        <p>Arequipa, often known as Peru's White City, is one of the country's most physically gorgeous cities, because to its distinctive colonial-era buildings made of volcanic rock (sillar). Beyond the white architecture of the main square, there are deep-hued testaments to the city's past, such as the blue and crimson Monasterio de Santa Catalina, erected in 1579, and bright picanterías. The Ruta del Sillar (Volcanic Rock Route) is located on the outskirts of the volcano-framed city and depicts the material's extraction, manufacture, and workers' daily life. Experience the majestic flight of the enormous Andean condor from the edge of Cañón Del Colca (Colca Canyon), one of the world's deepest canyons and a popular hiking destination in Peru.</p>

        <p>Lake Titicaca, which separates Bolivia and Peru, was considered a sacred body of water by the Incas. In reality, Andean tradition frequently refers to the high-altitude lake as the birthplace of the first Inca, Manco Capac, and his wife, Mama Ocllo. Lake Titicaca is a natural wonder that stands 3810 metres (12,500 feet) above sea level, making it the world's highest navigable body of water. Glide out to the lake's floating reed islands to meet the Uros, who live a fascinating existence dedicated to the preservation of Indigenous handicrafts and fishing traditions. Tourism is quite important to this village, and several households provide homestays.</p>

    <div class="place_caral">
        <img src="images/place_caral.webp" alt="Caral">
        <p>It's astonishing how few people visit the ancient city of Caral, which was established roughly 5000 years ago and is well preserved. The Unesco World Heritage Site in the Supe Valley, a 3½-hour drive from Lima, predates both ceramic pottery and the Incas. It is the key to the birth of Andean culture, a visible transition from different tribes to a common urban society. Visitors can stroll through what was once a complex Norte Chico city, consisting of mud-brick amphitheatres, ceremonial rooms, circular plazas, and the remains of six pyramids: remnants of urban planning and agricultural practices that would greatly influence subsequent Peruvian cultures.</p>

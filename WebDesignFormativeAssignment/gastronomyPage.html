        <p>Ceviche, Peru's national dish and one of its most popular cuisines, may lead to an immediate infatuation. Other countries (Mexico, Ecuador) have their own versions of the meal, but this raw fish served cold, which generally comprises sea bass (corvina) or any firm, lean, white fish marinated for a few minutes in lime juice, onion, salt, and fiery chilies (aji), is uniquely Peruvian.
        <br><br>
        Ceviche is frequently served with starchy boiled corn (choclo) and sweet potatoes (camote) to balance out the fiery protein. Dry roasted maize kernels (cancha) are strewn throughout to create a wonderful crunch.</p>

    <div class="food_Causa_Tag">

        <p>This traditional Quechan meal may be found in various varieties across Peru. The most popular variant is Causa Lime√±a, originating in Lima. Serve as a cake roll, casserole, terrine, or even in brightly coloured individual servings. The mash, whether made with yellow Peruvian potatoes, oil, lime, or spicy aji amarillo sauce, is the star of the show.
        <br><br>
        Most chefs combine shredded tuna, chicken, or salmon with mayonnaise to make the meat filling. They next add layers of hard-boiled eggs, avocado (palta in Spanish), and olives. The upper layer is always composed of more foundation mash.
        <br><br>
        Causa is always served cold, typically as a side dish or salad with a meal.</p>

        <p>Lomo saltado combines Chinese stir-fry with traditional Peruvian food.
        <br><br>
        Tender strips of beef (sometimes prepared with alpaca flesh) are marinated in soy sauce and mixed with onions, tomatoes, aji chilies, and other spices.
        <br><br>
        The ingredients are stir-fried until the beef is cooked through and the tomatoes and onions begin to form a gravy-like consistency. An East-meets-West starch combination: French fries (potatoes are a mainstay in Peruvian cuisine) and a pile of steaming white rice.</p>

        <p>Consider serving shredded chicken curry-style in a thick sauce made with cream, crushed walnuts, white cheese, and aji amarillo. The cream and cheese balance this light yet tasty sauce, which has a hint of aji spice. The chicken, veggies, and sauce are frequently served over a bed of rice, cooked potatoes, and black olives, giving it a thick, chowder-like consistency when plated.
        <br><br>
        This meal goes well with a dry white wine to balance out the sweetness of the spicy sauce.</p>
